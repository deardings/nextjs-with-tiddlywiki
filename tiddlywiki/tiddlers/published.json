You may choose which other fields to export/import by configuring the exporter and adjusting the imports on the frontend. For now, I skipped tags, because their listing and linking will not work automatically in the Next.js app. Internal links will <strong>not</strong> be working.</p><p>I have seen tiddlywiki inline images being published, too, but as they will get wikified/exported as text to \"published.json\" this is not recommendable. Better put all all your images inside of the \"public/img/\" folder and link to them like this: </p><pre><code>[img[/img/raphael-schaller-GkinCd2enIY-unsplash.jpg]]</code></pre><p><img class=\" tc-image-loading\" src=\"/img/raphael-schaller-GkinCd2enIY-unsplash.jpg\"></p><p>It's not pretty in the tiddlywiki, but works okay on the frontend. The features of Next.js' <code>&lt;Image /&gt;</code> component with it's optimization will not get used though.</p><p>For the title images I added the \"cover_image\"-field containing only the file name, the path to the \"public/img/\" folder is added in the [slug].tsx file and hero-post.tsx and post-preview.tsx.</p>",
